This project aims to generate sales reports using data from a single database. It reads data from different tables within the database and compiles them into a CSV file format.

__NOTE:__ The below python files expects the database file to be in working directory(directory in which python files are present) -
          1. sales_report_pandas.py
          2. sales_report_sql.py

__Prerequisite:__ The python files above have dependencies on other libraries such as pandas, sqlalchemy, etc. So, run the below pip command to install the dependencies using requirements.txt file before running the pyhton files -
                    **pip install -r requirements.txt**
